# Domani Driven Design

## Domanins

- A domain is a sphere of knowledge
- in the context of software, it refers to the business or idea that we are modeling
- experts in the domain are people who understand the business, not necessarely the software
- key goals of ddd is to build a model that the domain experts understand
    - Note: The model is not software
        - the model represents our understanding of the domain
        - the software is an implementation of the model

## Ubiquitous Language

- communication between developers and domain experts requires a common language
- terminology comes from the domain experts
- words originate in the domain and are used in the software
- avoid taking software terms and introducing them into the domain
- *domain experts and software developers should be able to have a conversation without resorting to software terms*
